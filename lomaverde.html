<h2>Howdy, Neighbors!</h2>

I would be delighted to put a Loma Verde page up here, including support
for things like chat boards, mailing lists, pictures, and the like.
(And improve the domain name!)
<p>
If you think this is a good idea or have suggestions, send me email
at rokicki@cs.stanford.edu.
<p>
Possible sections include:
<ul>
<li>Meet your neighbors!  A collection of photos of people who live and
play here.
</li>
<li>Helpful hints.  Things you've found to work you'd like to share.
Fans, awnings, storage, good contractors, etc.
</li>
<li>Discussion board.  People can start topics of conversation, post
messages, etc.
</li>
<li>A mailing list.  For those missives that need to get immediate
attention, or maybe just pointers to the discussion board.
</li>
<li>Classifieds.  Got a teen who can babysit?  Need someone to
water your plants for a week?</li>
<li>Lots more.  The web is a blast!</li>
</ul>
Note:  http://www.lomaverde.com/ is taken.  Sue suggestions
