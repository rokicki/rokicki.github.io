<h1>A Ray Tracer in 470 Lines of Perl?</h1>
I decided to try my hand at the 
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/">2000 ICFP</a>
since I always enjoy the
contests.  And this year was the most fun of all; I learned a lot!
To see the images I got, look <a href="images.html">here</a>.
<p>
I'd never written a ray tracer before, so the task description
taught me a lot.  And I came up with what I thought were some pretty
clever tricks---but I'm sure they aren't original.
<p>
I decided to write this in Perl since that's the language I can
prototype code in the fastest.  I also decided to cut some corners;
there was no way I could win given the time constraints I had (I
have a job!) and that I was a one-man team and that I had never
done anything in ray tracing before.  So I didn't worry about error
checking the input, and I didn't implement the strong typing
(floats vs ints).  These parts just weren't interesting to me.
<p>
Implementing the language was trivial; I simply translated the GML
into Perl.  Since Perl supports closures, lexical variables,
and first-class functions,
this was very easy, and it provided some speed since Perl is quite
fast as an interpreter.
<p>
Implementing the renderer was more difficult.  I am very familiar
with affine transformations in general (from PostScript), but not
with ray tracing or how angles get distorted, etc.  So I ended up
reinventing a lot of stuff, like how to map a normal.  (I knew how
to map a point and a vector, but was delighted with how elegant
mapping a normal turns out to be; use the transpose of the inverse
matrix!)
<p>
One neat trick I came up with was dealing with inverse transformations.
I did not want to compute matrix inverses, even of 4x4 matrices, because
it's difficult and ugly code.  So instead, I computed both the forward
and inverse matrix on each transformation step, and kept both with
the transformed objects!
<p>
Surface acne just wasn't a problem at all because I only considered
surfaces that were facing the proper way.  No need for kludges like
epsilons; just make sure the ray actually bounces off the visible
surface of the object rather than the underside.  You won't find
any numerical kludges in my code.
<p>
Because my renderer was so slow (being in Perl and all), I made it
generate intermediate files at 1/8th, 1/4th, and 1/2 the resolution
so I could check on its progress and correctness without waiting for
the full resolution.
<p>
Of course, I did the usual sphere bounding test on all objects, but
other than that, didn't really do anything for performance.  Because
of Perl, I'm already about 100x slower than a compiled language so
there's little hope of recovering sufficient speed.
<p>
At entry time, I thought I had a complete if slow Tier 2 entry
(if you ignore the fact that I don't do strong typing); that is, each
valid Tier 2 image should render correctly, but ones that cause
runtime errors would not necessarily throw an error.  Well I was
wrong.  There were at least five errors in my program:
<p>
<ul>
<li>  My z-depth computation was wrong; I wasn't scaling it properly
with the object transformations.  This was the major bug.  For simple
unscaled objects, it worked fine, but when you scaled an object, you
would get improper occlusions.  This didn't make a difference for
any tests but the golf test, and I didn't test against that one for
time reasons and because I didn't support CSG.
</li>
<li>  I had a sign error in my speculative lighting computation.  This
didn't make much difference for the small simple images, but it did
matter for dice, for instance.
</li>
<li>  I didn't catch Perl parse errors correctly.  This only mattered
for incorrect GML programs.
</li>
<li>  I didn't handle the Tier-3 spotlight command.  (I support all
Tier-3 commands; I just don't implement all of them correctly.)
</li>
<li>  I forgot to binmode the output file; this only affects you if you
run on DOS or NT or Win2K or something like that.
</li>
</ul>
I patched these up in the code <a href=gml.pl.txt>here</a>; my original
submission as a gzipped tar file is <a href=gml.tar.gz>here</a>.
The total came to about 470 lines of code.  It would be fairly
straightforward to cut the number of lines down significantly, but
I'll save that for an obfuscated Perl contest.
<p>
All in all, I tremendously enjoyed this contest and I applaud everyone
who entered and especially the judges!
