<h1>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h1>
Here are the images my renderer generated.  I'm including three
images for each:  what the submitted code generated, what
the `fixed' code generated, and what it should have generated.
I've converted all the files to GIF, which means that they have
been quantized down to 256 colors, so there may be subtle
imperfections that aren't in the original PPM files.

<h3>Spheres</h3>
No problem with this one.<br>

<image src="spheres-new.gif">
<image src="spheres-good.gif">
<h3>Spheres2</h3>
There is a very subtle problem
with the lighting; can you find it?<br>

<h3>Reflect</h3>
No problem with this one.<br>

<h3>Fib</h3>
No problem with this one.<br>

<h3>Checked Cube</h3>
This one I had no trouble with at all.<br>

<h3>Dice</h3>
My error in speculative lighting shows up in the first (bad)
image.  The z buffer error is also clear from the leftmost
cube.  The second image isn't correct because I don't implement
the CSG operators properly (but I do recognize and do *something*
with them).<br>

<h3>Spotlight</h3>
I don't really implement spots; I approximate them with point
lights, and this is the result.<br>

<image src="spotlight-good.gif">
<h3>Golf</h3>
The lack of CSG does me in here.  Notice the problems with the
zbuffer in the original image, too.<br>
