New results:  this CA can be run in n log n, as shown by
<a href="rl2.c.txt">this code</a>.  Compile and call it with
an argument of n; it will generate slightly less than the first
2*n million states.  My machine is tied up
with another program at the moment, but I've run the first 
100M states and they are in a <a href="rl2.log.gz">compressed log
file here</a> (20MB).  It took significantly longer to compress than
to generate the states themselves!
You should be able to easily generate at least
the first 3B states, assuming you have enough swap space.
You need 256K*n swap, approximately;
you don't need that much real memory, just swap space, although
you might run out of virtual address space first.

<a href="rl.log">Here's the old log</a>
of the photon CA states using the quadratic version.
We've calculated 10678290 states so far.
