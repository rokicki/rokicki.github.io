Flash:  We won second place overall!
<p>
We're six coders who met on TopCoder
(<a href="http://www.topcoder.com">check it out</a>).
Including coders in Germany, the United States, Australia, and Texas allowed
us to work around the clock.

<h3>Initial Strategy</h3>

In prior years some of us have had success with AIM and CVS, so we
decided to use these as our basic communication and source-control
infrastructure.  Putting the CVS tree on the web automatically
enabled us to keep track of status and share ideas and writeups.
One of us even kept a log of all AIM communications in our chat room
over the 72 hours, so we could easily catch up with what had happened
overnight.  We agreed to write all common code in C++.
<p>
At the start of the contest, one of us quickly (really, shockingly
quickly) got a simulator up and running.  It was this simulator that
was to become the basis of all of our code.  While this was being
written the rest of us (who were up and online) studied and thought
about the problem.
<p>
We observed that the 16-bit arithmetic was in fact quite precise,
sufficiently precise that we felt a good division of the problem was
to write one program to find a good continuous solution, and another
program to turn that continuous solution into a discrete solution.
Yet a third effort would be to do microoptimizations on a discrete
solution (that is, try to improve an existing solution by making
mostly local modifications).
<p>
<a href="sample.gif"><img src="samples.gif" align="right"></a>
In addition to these efforts, we wanted some good visualization of
the traces including a graph of velocity,
acceleration and braking, and requested turns.  We also wanted a
trace management process, where as we generated traces for the
various tracks, we could check them in and they would be automatically
verified by the simulator, ranked against each other, and the current
status web page updated.  One of the advantages of having such a large
team is that we were able to pursue such parallel efforts.

<h3>Linear Subsequences</h3>
Our efforts at a continuous solution got off to a great start.  
We decided that (even for the discrete optimizer) it made little
sense to consider strings of relatively random moves.  Instead, we
felt any particular "short enough" subsequence of an optimal trace
would show some straightforward characteristics, and we called such
a sequence a "linear subsequence":
<ul>
<li>One that does not have *both* braking and acceleration;</li>
<li>One that does not have *both* right and left turns;</li>
<li>One for which the different moves are evenly distributed.</li>
</ul>
For instance, one linear sequence of moves would be
<pre>
   a.r.a.r.a.r.a.r.a.r.a.r.
</pre>
Here we are alternately accelerating and turning right, so we are
accelerating about 50% of the time and turning right about 50% of the
time.  We could also for instance
<pre>
   ar.a.ar.a.ar.a.
</pre>
where we are accelerating 100% of the time and turning right 50% of the
time.
<p>
We felt that using long linear subsequences allowed us to reduce the
search space significantly, while still permitting us to find
near-optimal solutions.
<p>
<img src="base.gif" align="left">
Indeed, we can generalize such linear subsequences in two dimensions
by allowing any arbitrary fraction of acceleration/braking
or turning.  The lower two
quadrants look like triangles because you cannot brake
and turn in the same move.  We observed that any optimal solution
almost certainly consisted of linear subsequences that were
on the border of the five-sided figure.  If the sequence
were not on the border, it could be split into two shorter
sequences that followed the same path, pretty much exactly,
but in less time.  Thus, the a.r.a.r.a.r... example above would
never occur in a real optimal trace.
<p>
The simple case is if the path is a simple straight line.
Any straight line (with a specific entrance and exit velocity)
is best traversed by maximally accelerating and then maximally
braking.  That is, there should never be a sequence of just
"rolling".  For a curve, the same is true; for any particular
turning radius, there's a maximum speed at which the car can
maintain that path.  The optimal path accelerates as close
to that speed as it can, and then brakes as much as it needs to
at the end to meet the required exit velocity.
<p>
Thus, when deciding what linear subsequences to consider, we
never need to consider (for instance) 50% acceleration and
50% turning.  This reduced the set of paths to consider by
an entire dimension.

<h3>Good in theory, but . . .</h3>
<img src="tomcar.jpg" align="right">
Beyond this, our search for globally optimal continuous
solutions stumbled.  We were able to get to the point
that we could calculate the maximum traversal speed of any path
described by arcs of a circle, portions of spirals generated by linear
subsequences, and lines very very quickly,
but were unable to put this into an optimization framework
in time.
<p>
Meanwhile, work was progressing on our discrete optimizer and
on our microoptimizer.  For various reasons, the microoptimizer
was not generating very good traces, and neither was the discrete
optimizer (although we were getting some traces).
<p>
Then, all of the sudden, the discrete optimizer started generating
(what looked like to us at the time) very reasonable traces.
The discrete optimizer worked by maintaining a set of current
candidate solutions, advancing them by different sets of ten moves
(all subsequences on the envelope), culling the now much larger set
into a smaller set, and repeating until we had a solution.  Much
work went into tuning this algorithm, and we scurried around to
find machines to run it on.
<p>
<a href="2_Hairpins_eqp.gif"><img src="2_Hairpins_eqps.gif" align="left"></a>
While those traces were being run (very late in the contest), one
of us came up with the idea of taking the result we had found so
far, and eliminating all portions of the map that were more than
some number of pixels away from that path, and rerunning the
discrete optimization on this new, constrained map.  This improved
our results even more.
<p>
Very late in the contest, really kind of embarrassingly late, we
realized how much the simulator (which formed the heart of our
discrete optimizer) could be sped up by replacing most of the
calculations by simple table lookups.  This change was too late to
have an impact on our results, and that's too bad because it
could have increased our effective computational power
significantly.
<p>
In the end, we submitted what we felt were a very nice set of
traces.  We are not sharing these traces at this point in time
because we do not want to ruin the suspense of the contest,
although we are quite certain we did not place.

<h3>Never Satisfied.</h3>

One of us has spent significant time after the contest writing
yet another discrete optimizer; the results of this are at
