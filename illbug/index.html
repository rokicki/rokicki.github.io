<body>
New information:  Illustrator 7.0 can also generate bad BeginData/EndData
sections with bad byte counts.  The fixill.pl script (below) has been
updated to fix these too.  These files will cause dvips 5.90
problems, but I hope to fix this problem too somehow.

Illustrator versions 8.0 and 9.0 generate invalid DSC at the top
of their files, and this causes dvips to reject these files
when comment elision (-K) is turned on.
Essentially, the byte count in the hex thumbnail section is
flagrantly incorrect.<p>

I have prepared a detailed <a href="README">bug report</a> with
associated <a href="bug.tar.gz">data files</a>.<p>

I am testing a patch to dvips that works around this problem for
the next release of dvips.  If you want you can try using
<a href="output.diffs">patch</a> to dvips 5.86e.<p>

If you have broken EPSF files, I have written a Perl script that may
fix them.  It is available <a href="fixill.pl">here</a>, or, if
your system insists on executing scripts with the PL extension,
you can also get it <a href="fixill.pl.txt">here</a> as text.
