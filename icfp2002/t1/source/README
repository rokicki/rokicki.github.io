Meet Les.  Les is a bot who was once oblivious, but learned basic tactics
and strategy.  He is 20% learning, 30% money and 50% traveling.  Les's
hobbies include gold mining, scavaging and weight lifting.  He abhors
swimming, but is not afraid of pushing his buddy bots in the pool.

Les would like to take a moment to thank his sponsors: a professional, a 
student, and a layman; hackers from Silicon Valley, without whom he could
not have made it as far as he did.

To put Les into action, invoke him as follows:

   ./runme <hostname> <portnumber>

Les is actually a lazy bot, likes to sit around and think more than move.
If you would like Les to move faster just tell him:

   -m <integer number of moves per second>

If you want Les to be more loquacious, you can use

   -v

but be prepared for the torrent!  To save the moves that Les makes,
perhaps for replay, you can use

   -s <savefile>

These and all other options must come before the hostname and portnumber.

Les is a very functional robot.
