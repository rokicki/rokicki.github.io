* sim.c, sim.h:

Simulates the game

arguments:
	sim [-p] worldfile ant1 ant2 [trace]

worldfile, ant1 and ant2 are the input files.

Placing a 0 as the [trace] option will suppress output of the trace file.

Using "all" as the worldfile will run the simulation on the files
worlds/sample[0..9].world, for each assignment of ants to colours, and
tally the results.  The trace file will only be written for the first
simulation.

If ant1 or ant2 are .antc files, then the compiler antc.pl is called to
compile the file to a .ant file first.

The -p option will send the trace information to stdout, so it can be piped
to AntSim as follows:

sim -p worldfile ant1 ant2 | java AntSim - 4 1


* antc.pl:

arguments:
	perl antc.pl input.antc


Compiler for an extended version of the ant language.  Takes a .antc
input file and produces a .ant file as required for the problem.

Allows macros, if and while constructions, and labels.

We have many of our ants written in the .antc language in the ants/
directory.  The syntax is similar to a greatly simplified C.  Using macros in m4 simplifies matters greatly.


* AntSim.java:

Plays back the game in a graphical format, using a trace file output by
sim.c.

arguments:
	java AntSim tracefile gridsize autogo

tracefile is the input files, or "-" to read from stdin.
Gridsize is the required size of each cell.
autogo will start the playback automatically.
A negative value for delay indicates that the screen only be redrawn every -delay instructions of the trace file.


* tourn.pl (old version tournament.pl)

Given a list of ants, plays a round-robin tournament between them using
sim.c, and tabulates the results.

* generate_ant_identification.cpp

This tool produces .antc code for an initialization routine that determines
the initial position of the each ant on the hill.


* pnc.pl

A netcat-like tool in perl.


* verify.cpp

Verifies that a .ant file matches the grammar, and that all state
references are valid.
