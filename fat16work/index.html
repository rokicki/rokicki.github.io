This page is presently out of date.  More recent work, with
significantly higher speed and more functionality, is on
<a href="http://fsrw.sf.net">sourceforge</a> and in the
Propeller object exchange.
<p>
News:  I've released <a href="fsrw-and-friends-1.6.zip">fsrw1.6</a>
which fixes a bug when you mix pputc() and pwrite() in the same file.
</p>
<p>
Here's some code to support FAT16 filesystem reading and writing from the
propeller, as well as some low-level Secure Digital block I/O code.
</p>
<p>
The current version <a href="fsrw-and-friends-1.6.zip">(download here)</a>
is 1.6, last updated 23 September 2008.
</p>
<p>
If you try this code please send me email (rokicki at gmail.com) on how
it works for you and what is lacking that you need.
</p>
<p>
More details on the code can be found <a href="README.txt">here</a>.
